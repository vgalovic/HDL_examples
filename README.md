HDL Examples (VHDL & Verilog)
=============================

This repository contains a collection of HDL (Hardware Description Language) examples that I created while practicing VHDL and Verilog in the Vivado environment. The examples are organized into different practice sections to showcase various concepts and techniques in FPGA design.

## Structure

The repository is organized into language-specific folders (`VHDL/` and `Verilog/`), each containing multiple practice sections. Within each practice section, you will find simulation files (`sim/`), source files (`src/`), and a `setup.tcl` script to automate the Vivado project setup. This structure is designed to help you easily navigate and work on different sections based on the HDL language you're using.

- `VHDL/`: Contains VHDL-based examples organized by practice sections.
  - `<practice-section>/`: A specific practice section.
    - `sim/`: Simulation files for the practice section.
    - `src/`: Source files for the practice section.
    - `setup.tcl`: TCL script for setting up the Vivado project for the practice section.

- `Verilog/`: Contains Verilog-based examples organized by practice sections.
  - `<practice-section>/`: A specific practice section.
    - `sim/`: Simulation files for the practice section.
    - `src/`: Source files for the practice section.
    - `setup.tcl`: TCL script for setting up the Vivado project for the practice section.
