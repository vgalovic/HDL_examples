HDL Examples (VHDL & Verilog)
=============================

This repository contains a collection of HDL examples I created while practicing VHDL and Verilog. The examples are organized by language (VHDL and Verilog) and by different practice sections. Each section includes a `setup.tcl` file to easily create and configure the project in Vivado.
